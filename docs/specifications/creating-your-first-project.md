# Abstract

_**Sign-In with Wallet**_ allows Web3 wallet account owners to authenticate with off-chain services by signing with their wallet

A first implementation is delivered for Cardano browser-plugin wallets.

The goals of this specification are to provide a self-custody alternative to centralized identity providers, improve interoperability across off-chain services for Cardano-based authentication, and provide wallet vendors and website/app owners with a consistent solution for improving end-user experience during authentication and consent management.
