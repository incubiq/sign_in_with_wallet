# 1. Have a wallet available



{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you have a wallet plugin installed in your browser. In our case, we use cardano wallets. Our libraries have been extensively tested with Nami wallet. We have also used a few additional wallets (Yoroi, Eternl) for more sporadic tests.
