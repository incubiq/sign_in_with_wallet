# Abstract

_**Sign-In with Wallet**_ allows Web3 wallet account owners to authenticate with Web2 and Web3 apps using their wallet credentials instead of traditional social media accounts. The implementation also allows for providing the calling app with custom defined Authorization levels.

A first implementation is delivered for Cardano browser-plugin wallets.

The goals of this specification are to provide a self-custody alternative to centralized identity providers, improve interoperability across off-chain services for Cardano-based authentication, and provide wallet vendors and website/app owners with a consistent solution for improving end-user experience during authentication and consent management.
