# 1. Setup passport-wallet

We will first assume that you are familiar with **PassportJS**, and that you have already installed the following npm packages.

```
npm install passport
npm install passport-jwt
```

A **passport-wallet** strategy was developed to simplify a backend authentication via SIWW. Note that it requires (and will install) passport-oauth2.

Run the following command to install the **passport-wallet** authentication strategy.

```
npm install @incubiq/passport-wallet
```
