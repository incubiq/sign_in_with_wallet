# Motivation

{% hint style="info" %}
An alternative to the usual **Sign-in with Facebook** and the likes, where you are more in control over the shared metadata.
{% endhint %}

When signing-in to non-blockchain services, users will typically use identity providers that are centralized entities with ultimate control over users' identifiers, for example, social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn), or email/infrastructure providers (Google, Apple). Incentives are often misaligned between these parties. Sign-In with Cardano offers a self-custody option for users who wish to assume more control and responsibility over their own digital identity.

This project is an opportunity to standardize the sign-in workflow and improve interoperability across existing services. At the same time, it will provide wallet vendors a reliable method to identify signing requests as Sign-In with Cardano.
