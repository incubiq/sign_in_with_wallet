| Got this Error?                                                  | Check this...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Got redirected to /auth/unauthorized (the failureRedirect route) | Looks like the authentication went as planned till the end, but still failed. Check that your **clientSecret** is correctly set (probably this problem)                                                                                                                                            |
| Failed to obtain access token                                    | <p>You re probably passing an incorrect callbackURL.</p><p></p><p>The <strong>callbackURL</strong> parameter of the passportSIWW strategy must start with http://...; if you sent a relative path, such as /auth/siww/callback, you just cannot be called back from the SignWithWallet server.</p> |
| Failed to obtain access token                                    | Another case of failure is if pass in parameters authorizationURL or tokenURL or profileURL, the unsecure **http**://signwithwallet.com/ instead of **https**://signwithwallet.com/                                                                                                                |
| This application is not properly configured for authentication   | <p>You are probably calling with an invalid app_id. </p><p></p><p>The <strong>ClientID</strong> parameter of the passportSIWW strategy must be a registered app_id, which you got at configuration time</p>                                                                                        |
| Could not identify caller!                                       | This should not show up in normal case. A **refresh** of the page will generally fix it.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
